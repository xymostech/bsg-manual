# Battlestar Galactica

The Cylons were created to make life easier on the Twelve Colonies. And then
the day came when the Cylons decided to kill their masters. After a long and
bloody struggle, an armistice was declared and the Cylons left for another
world to call their own.

Forty years later, they returned, and brought humanity to the brink of
extinction. The remaining humans, led by the crew of the Battlestar Galactica,
fled in hope of finding a new home, one known by legend as Earth.

Humanity's only hope lies in finding Earth's location while fighting off the
unrelenting Cylons. But as resources run low, it is discovered that the enemy
can now appear human and has infiltrated the fleet from the inside. Game
Overview

_Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game_ provides a unique gaming experience.
Unlike most games where players win individually, Battlestar Galactica is a
team game, with the added complication that which players are on which teams is
kept secret.

Each player is secretly assigned a team at the start of the game. The two teams
are the humans and the Cylons, and each team has a specific objective. The
human players are trying to find the map to Earth, while the Cylon players
simply want to annihilate the human race. Players win or lose with the other
members of their teamâ€¦but must figure out who they can trust in order to lead
their team to victory.

## Component Breakdown

### Game Board

The game board is where the main action of the game takes place. It depicts the
locations on Galactica and Colonial One, as well as the areas of space
surrounding them. For a full diagram of the game board, see "Game Board
Breakdown" on page 8.

### Resource Dials and Plastic Connectors

The resource dials are used to track the dwindling resources of the humans.
They are attached to the game board using the plastic connectors (see the
"Installing Resource Dials" diagram on page 5).

### Character Sheets

Each character has a sheet that describes that character's skill set and
special abilities.

### Character Tokens and Stands

Each character is represented by a token that is slotted into a plastic stand.

### Piloting Tokens

Each character who has the ability to pilot has a corresponding piloting token.
A character's piloting token is placed under a viper when that character is
piloting it.

### Current Player Token

This token is used to help the players remember which player is currently
taking their turn.

### Nuke Tokens

The Admiral starts the game with two nuke tokens. These powerful weapons can
destroy basestars, but are finite and should not be wasted.

### Civilian Ship Tokens

These tokens represent the civilian ships that the humans must protect during
Cylon attacks. These tokens have a common back, and the face lists the
resources (usually population) that are lost if that ship is destroyed.

### Basestars

These large tokens represent the Cylon basestars, which can attack Galactica
and launch raiders during combat.

### Centurion Markers

These markers are used to track progress on the Boarding Party track. Should
any of these tokens reach the end of the track, the humans lose the game (see
"Activate Heavy Raiders and Centurions" on page 24).

### Damage Tokens

These tokens represent the vital systems that can be damaged when Galactica or
a basestar is hit by an enemy attack.

### Fleet Marker

This marker is used to track progress on the Jump Preparation track. When this
token reaches the end of the track, the fleet jumps to its next destination
(see "Jumping the Fleet" on page 13).

### Destination Cards

These cards are used when the fleet jumps, to determine which destination the
fleet reaches.

### Kobol Objective Card

This card lists when the sleeper agent phase takes place and how the human
players win the game.

### Skill Cards

These cards are drawn by players at the start of their turn. These cards are
used to overcome crises, or may be played to provide special abilities. Each
character has access to different skills and will therefore be able to help
overcome different types of crises.

### President and Admiral Title Cards

These cards grant the owner a special action, as well as the ability to make
important decisions posed by certain Crisis Cards. One player starts the game
with each of these cards, but they often change hands throughout the game.

### Quorum Cards

These cards can be drawn by the President, and can increase morale, help deal
with Cylon players, or provide special abilities for other players.

### Crisis Cards

These cards represent the different roadblocks and disasters the human players
must overcome. Some of these cards require skill checks, while others represent
Cylon attacks. These cards are the main way resources are lost.

### Super Crisis Cards

These five cards represent extremely dangerous crises. When a Cylon player
reveals themself, they receive one of these cards (see "Revealed Cylon Players"
on page 19).

### Loyalty Cards

Each player is dealt one Loyalty Card at the start of the game, and another one
halfway through the game. These cards are kept secret and inform each player
whether or not they are a Cylon (see "Revealed Cylon Players" on page 19).

### Eight-sided Die

This die is used primarily to resolve combat, but may also be used by certain
Crisis Cards.

### Plastic Ships

These plastic ships are used during Cylon attacks. Their limited quantities
make them a precious commodity.

## Setup

Follow these steps to prepare to play Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game.

1. Place Game Board: Place the game board at the center of the table. Set the
   food and fuel dials to "8," the morale dial to "10," and the population dial
   to "12."
2. Set Up Tokens and Ships: Place the eight vipers and four raptors in the
   "Viper and Raptor Reserves" space of the game board. Then place the fleet
   token on the start space of the Jump Preparation track. Last, place all
   other tokens (facedown) and plastic ships adjacent to the game board.
3. Determine First Player: Randomly choose a player to be the first player, and
   give him the current player token. This player will choose his character
   first and take the first turn of the game.
4. Choose and Place Characters: Starting with the first player and proceeding
   clockwise, each player chooses a character of the character type(s) that is
   most plentiful (political leader, military leader, or pilot). This
   restriction does not apply to support characters, who may be chosen at any
   time. After choosing a character, the player receives the corresponding
   character sheet and stand-up character token, as well as a piloting token if
   applicable. He then places his character token on the location specified on
   his character sheet.

   Example: The first player chooses Laura Roslin (a political leader) as his
   character. The next player may choose any military leader or pilot (since
   they are the most plentiful). He could also choose a support character.
5. Distribute Title Cards: The President title is given to the first available
   player in the following list: Laura Roslin, Tom Zarek, and Gaius Baltar. The
   Admiral title is given to the first available player in the following list:
   William Adama, Saul Tigh, and Helo Agathon. The Admiral is then given the
   two nuke tokens, and the President shuffles the Quorum deck and draws one
   Quorum Card.
6. Set Up Loyalty Deck: Set up the Loyalty deck according to the "Creating the
   Loyalty Deck" sidebar on page 6.
7. Set Up Other Cards: Shuffle the Quorum deck, Crisis deck, Super Crisis deck,
   and Destination deck and then place them next to the game board. Then
   separate the Skill Cards into five decks by type, as shown on their faces.
   Shuffle each deck separately, and then place them (facedown) below the
   matching colored regions at the bottom of the game board. Lastly, place the
   Kobol Objective Card faceup next to the Destination deck.
8. Receive Skills: Each player, except the starting player, draws a total of
   three Skill Cards from among any of the cards he can draw during his Receive
   Skills step (see "Receive Skills Step" on page 9). The starting player does
   not receive Skill Cards now, but will draw Skill Cards at the start of his
   turn.
9. Create Destiny Deck: Deal two Skill Cards of each skill type facedown onto
   the "Destiny deck" space on the game board and shuffle them thoroughly.
10. Set Up Ships: Place one basestar and three raiders in front of Galactica.
   Then place two vipers below Galactica and two civilian ships behind
   Galactica (as shown below).

### Installing Resource Dials

Before playing the game for the first time, attach the four resource dials to
the game board. These dials are used to track the fleet's dwindling resources
throughout each game. To attach a dial, simply push one side of a plastic
connector through the board, and the other side through the dial. Then push
them together until they fit snugly together. Once attached, they should not be
removed. The number a given dial shows represents how much of that particular
resource is available at that time. When a resource is lost or gained for any
reason, its dial is rotated to indicate the new total. If any resource is
reduced to zero (at the end of a player's turn), then the human players lose
the game.

## Object of the Game

The object of the game for a given player depends on which team they belong to.
A player's team is determined by the Loyalty Cards they receive throughout the
game (see [[Loyalty Cards]]). All human players win the game if they travel at
least eight units of distance (as specified by the [[Kobol Objective Card]])
and then jump one final time (see "Human Objective" on page 12).

All Cylon players win the game by preventing the humans from reaching their
objective. They usually accomplish this goal by running the fleet out of a
resource (food, fuel, morale, or population), but can also win by destroying
Galactica (see "Damage Tokens" on page 25) or successfully invading Galactica
with centurion boarding parties (see "Activate Heavy Raiders and Centurions" on
page 24).

## Creating the Loyalty Deck

1. Organize Loyalty Cards: Remove the "You Are a Sympathizer" card from the
   Loyalty deck. Then separate the remainder of the deck into two piles ("You
   Are Not a Cylon" and "You are a Cylon"). Shuffle the "You Are a Cylon" pile.
2. Create Deck: Deal the appropriate number of "You Are a Cylon" and "You are
   not a Cylon" cards into the Loyalty deck as listed below.

Three Players: Create a six-card deck consisting of:

1x "You Are a Cylon" card
5x "You Are Not a Cylon" cards

Four Players: Create a seven-card deck consisting of:

1x "You Are a Cylon" card
6x "You Are Not a Cylon" cards

Five Players: Create a 10-card deck consisting of:

2x "You Are a Cylon" cards
8x "You Are Not a Cylon" cards

Six Players: Create an 11-card deck consisting of:

2x "You Are a Cylon" cards
9x "You Are Not a Cylon" cards

3. Add one extra "You Are Adjust Deck for Characters: Not a Cylon" card for
   each "Gauis Baltar" or "Sharon Valerii" character playing.
4. Shuffle the deck thoroughly Shuffle and Distribute: and then deal one
   Loyalty Card facedown to each player.
5. If playing a four or six player game, Add Sympathizer: add the "You Are a
   Sympathizer" card to the deck and then shuffle it.
6. Place the remaining Loyalty deck next to Place Deck: the game board. All
   extra Loyalty Cards (i.e., those not added to the deck) are placed back in
   the game box without looking at them.

### Choosing Optimal Characters

When choosing characters, it is important to be aware of which characters have
already been chosen. The last player, in particular, should take the skill sets
of other players' characters into account when making their own choice. For
example, if no other players have chosen a character with the engineering
skill, it may be a good idea to choose one who does have it.

## Game Board Breakdown

1. Destiny Deck Location: Two cards of each Skill Card type are placed here to
   form the Destiny Deck. Two cards from this deck are added to every skill
   check.
2. Damaged Viper Box: When a viper is damaged, it is placed here.
3. Viper and Raptor Reserves: All vipers and raptors that have not been
   launched, damaged, or destroyed are placed here. This space is often
   referred to as simply the "Reserves."
4. Resource Dials: These dials keep track of the fleet's dwindling resources.
5. Colonial One Locations: These locations may be moved to and activated by
   human players. Players must discard a Skill Card to move between Colonial
   One and Galactica.
6. Cylon Locations: When a Cylon player is revealed, their character token is
   moved to, and then among, these locations. Other players may never move to
   or activate these locations.
7. Jump Preparation Track: The fleet marker is placed on this track, and marks
   how close the fleet is to jumping.
8. Boarding Party Track: Centurion markers are placed on this track. If a
   centurion marker reaches the end of this track, then the humans lose the
   game.
9. Space Areas: Basestars, civilian, and plastic ships are placed in these six
   areas, each separated by thick blue lines. The concentric circles in space
   areas have no game effect.
10. Galactica Location: These locations may be moved to and activated by the
   human players. Players must discard a Skill Card to move between Galactica
   and Colonial One.
11. Hazard Locations: These two locations have ongoing negative effects.
    Players may never voluntarily move to these locations.
12. Viper Launch Icons: These icons represent the space areas in which vipers
    may be launched. Note that there are no launch icons on the other side of
    Galactica because, thematically, the starboard hangar deck was a museum and
    later housed refugees.
13. Skill Deck Regions: These colored regions mark where the appropriate Skill
    decks should be placed.

## Game Turn

_Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game_ is played over a number of game turns.
Starting with the first player and proceeding clockwise, players take complete
game turns in order until either the human or Cylon players have won the game.
Each game turn consists of the following steps, carried out in order:

1. Receive Skills Step: The current player draws the number and types of Skill
   Cards listed on their character sheet (see "Receive Skills Step" on this
   page).
2. Movement Step: The current player may move to a different location. If they
   move to a different ship (from Galactica to Colonial One or vice versa),
   they must discard one Skill Card from their hand.
3. Action Step: The current player chooses one action to perform. Options
   include the actions listed on their location, character sheet, and Skill
   Cards (see the full list of actions on page 10).
4. Crisis Step: The top card of the Crisis deck is drawn and then resolved (see
   "Crisis Step" on page 10).
5. Activate Cylon Ships Step (if necessary): If any are in play, Cylon ships
   are activated according to the Crisis Card drawn (see "Activate Cylon Ships
   Step" on page 11).
6. Jump Step (if necessary): If the Crisis Card Prepare for has the "prepare
   for jump" icon on it (see "Prepare for Jump Step" on page 11), the fleet
   token advances one space up the Jump Preparation track. If the token reaches
   the end of this track, then the fleet jumps (see "Jumping the Fleet" on page
   13).

After the Prepare for Jump step, the current player's turn
is over, and they hand the current player token clockwise to
the player on their left. This player then begins their turn starting
with the Receive Skills step.

## Game Turn Detail

The following section explains each step of a player's turn in
detail.

### Receive Skills Step

During this step, the current player draws Skill Cards
according to the skill set listed on their character sheet. The
player always draws the cards listed on their character sheet
regardless of the number of cards already in their hand.

Example: It is William Adama's Receive Skills step. They look at their skill
set, which lists 3 leadership and 2 tactics. They therefore draw three
leadership Skill Cards and two tactics cards. Some character sheets list
multi-colored skills known as multi-skills. When a character with a multi-skill
receives Skill Cards, they must first decide how many cards they will draw from
each type. The total number of cards that they draw must be equal to the number
listed on their sheet.

Example of a Multi-Skill

Example: It is the start of Lee "Apollo" Adama's turn. They therefore draw two
piloting and one tactics Skill Cards according to the skill set listed on their
character sheet. They may then decide to draw two leadership or two politics
Skill Cards - or one of each - since they have a 2 leadership/politics
multi-skill.

### Movement Step

During this step, the current player may move their character token to another
location if they wish. If they move to a different ship, they must discard one
Skill Card from their hand. Human characters may not move to Cylon locations,
and revealed Cylons may only move to Cylon locations.

Example: It is Lee "Apollo" Adama's movement step, and they wishes to move from
"Command" (on Galactica) to the "Press Room" (on Colonial One). They discard a
piloting Skill Card from their hand and move to the "Press Room" location. If
the player's character is piloting a viper, they may move to an adjacent space
area during this step, or may discard a Skill Card to move to a location on
Galactica or Colonial One and return their viper to the "Reserves."

### Action Step

During this step, the current player chooses one action to
perform. The action types are listed below, and are usually
identified by the word "Action:" followed by an ability.

 - The player may perform the action Activate Location: listed on their
   character's current location.
 - The player may play a Skill Card from Skill Card Action: their hand to
   perform the action specified on the card. Note that not all Skill Cards have
   actions on them (see "Skill Cards" on page 15).
 - The player may perform an action Character Action: listed on their character
   sheet. Note that only some character sheets have actions listed on them.
 - If the player is piloting a viper, they may Activate their Viper:
   activate it to move or to attack a Cylon ship.
 - If the player has a Title or Quo- Title and Quorum Cards: rum Card that
   provides them with an action, then they may perform it during this step.
 - The character may reveal one of their "You Loyalty Card: are a Cylon"
   Loyalty Cards to perform the specified action on it. They then follow the
   rules for revealed Cylon players on page 19.
 - If the player does not wish to perform any Do Nothing: actions, they may
   decide to do nothing during this step and proceed to the Crisis step.

### Crisis Step

During this step, the current player draws the top card of the Crisis deck,
reads it aloud, and then resolves it. There are three types of Crisis Cards:
Cylon attacks, skill checks, and events.

#### Cylon Attack Crises

These Crisis Cards feature an image of Galactica and some surrounding ships.
When resolving a Cylon attack Crisis Card, simply follow the steps listed on
it. Then discard the card unless instructed to keep the card in play.

#### Skill Check Crises

These Crisis Cards list a difficulty and one or more skill types, listed as
colored boxes, in the upper left corner. These cards are resolved according to
the rules for skill checks (see "Skill Checks" on page 16) and have outcomes
based on whether the players pass or fail the skill check. Some of these cards
give the current player, the President, or the Admiral the choice to either
resolve the skill check or carry out some alternate instruction.

#### Event Crises

Any Crisis Card that is not a Cylon attack or skill check is an event. These
crises have instructions that must be immediately followed. Some of them
provide a decision for the current player, the President, or the Admiral.

#### Activate Cylon Ships Step

If there is at least one Cylon ship in play, then the Cylon ships may move or
attack based on the icon on the bottom left of the Crisis Card (see "Activating
Cylon Ships" on page 22).

### Prepare for Jump Step

If the drawn Crisis Card has the "prepare for jump" icon on its lower right
corner, then the fleet token moves one space ahead (toward the "Auto Jump"
space) on the Jump Preparation track. If this causes the token to move to the
"Auto Jump" space, then the fleet jumps to a new destination (see "Jumping the
Fleet" on page 13).

After this step, the current player's turn is over. They discard any Crisis
Cards drawn this turn, and hand the current player token to the player on their
left, who begins their turn (starting with the Receive Skills step).

## Losing Resources

The four resources (fuel, food, morale, and population) are all vital to the
survival of humanity. These resources are usually lost due to Crisis Cards,
civilian ships being destroyed, or Galactica damage tokens.

Crisis cards list resource loss as text, for example "-1 population," while
tokens list resource loss as a number of red icons. For example, one red
population icon means the same as "-1 population." The list of resource icons
is found below as well as on the game board.

Whenever a resource is lost for any reason, the appropriate resource dial is
adjusted to represent the new total. The red color on the resource wheels tells
players when a resource is half (or less) full, and is used by sympathizer
Loyalty Cards (see page 18).

## Core Rules

This section explains the core components and rules of the game. In particular,
this section focuses on the human players and describes characters, jumping the
fleet, and skills.

### Characters

Each player takes on the role of a character from the Battlestar Galactica
universe. Each character has different strengths and weaknesses as listed on
their character sheet. The following information can be found on each character
sheet.

 - Each character has a type listed on their Character Type: character sheet.
   This type only matters during setup, and exists to help players choose a
   well-rounded group of characters.
 - Each character has two positive Character Abilities: abilities and one
   negative ability. Some of these abilities are passive (always affecting the
   character) while others require the player to use them as an action (see
   "Action Step" on page 10).
 - Each character sheet lists the skills the Skill Set: character has expertise
   in. At the start of the player's turn, they gain the number and types of
   Skill Cards listed in their character's skill set. When a character is
   allowed to draw Skill Cards of an unspecified type, they must be from within
   their skill set unless specified otherwise.

   Example: William Adama is in the "Research Lab" and uses the action listed
   there to draw one tactics or one engineering card. They may choose to draw
   engineering even though it is outside their skill set, because the location
   specifies the card type.
 - Each character has setup instructions on their Setup: card. This usually
   lists the location where the character is placed at the beginning of the
   game. Some characters have special instructions (such as "Apollo," whose
   sheet instructs the player to launch a viper and place them in it as a
   pilot).

Each character is represented by a stand-up character token, which is used to
track their location on the game board. After the character tokens are punched
out, each one is attached to a plastic character stand.

### Title Cards

Title and Quorum Cards provide powerful abilities to the player who controls
them. Title Cards are assigned at the beginning of the game, but may change
hands through the use of certain locations or because of cetain Crisis Cards.
In addition to the abilities listed below, the President and Admiral are given
many important decisions to make by Crisis Cards.

### The President and Quorum Cards

The President starts the game with one Quorum Card in their hand and can draw
more using the President Title Card, or "President's Office" location. These
cards provide special actions that only the President can perform and provide
them a wide range of powerful abilities.

Whichever player has the President title has control over this hand of Quorum
Cards. These cards are kept secret, and there is no limit to the number of
cards that may be in the President's hand.

### The Admiral

The Admiral has two important abilities. First off, they start the game with
two nuke tokens. These tokens can be devastatingly effective against basestars,
but are an extremely limited resource.

Second, the Admiral is the player who decides which destination the fleet
travels to when jumping (see "Jumping the Fleet" on the following page). This
decision can be extremely beneficial or harmful to the human players.

### Human Objective

For the human players to win the game, they must successfully jump the fleet
enough times to reach Kobol. Once the fleet has reached Kobol, the humans
immediately win the game. For information on the Cylon players' objective, see
"Cylon Objective" on page 18.

The fleet jumps to a new location in one of two ways.

1. The fleet token is moved to the "Auto Jump" space of the Jump Preparation
   track (see "Prepare for Jump Step" on page 11).
2. A player activates the "FTL Control" location. If the fleet jumps this way,
   then some population may be lost (see "FTL Control Jump" on the following
   page).

2. Character Type (Political Leader, Military Leader, Pilot, or Support)

### Jumping the Fleet

In Battlestar Galactica, moving ships at faster-than-light (FTL) speed is
referred to as "jumping." Whenever the fleet jumps, the Admiral draws
Destination Cards to determine where the fleet jumps to. To choose the
destination, the Admiral performs the following steps:

1. Remove Ships: Remove all ships from the game board (see "Jumping During
   Combat" on page 25).
2. Choose Destination: The Admiral draws two cards from the Destination deck,
   chooses one, and places the other on the bottom of the deck.
3. Follow Instructions: The Admiral places the chosen card faceup next to the
   Kobol Objective Card and follows any instructions on the Destination Card.
4. Kobol Instructions: If the previous step causes the total distance on
   Destination Cards placed adjacent to the Kobol Objective Card to equal or
   exceed four or eight for the first time, then follow the instructions on the
   Kobol Objective Card (see page 14).
5. Reset Jump Preparation Track: Move the fleet token to the start space of the
   Jump Preparation track.

### FTL Control Jump

If the fleet marker has moved to one of the blue spaces of the Jump Preparation
track, players may force the fleet to jump using the "FTL Control" location. If
the fleet jumps due to someone activating this location, there is a chance that
the fleet will lose some population.

The current player rolls the die, and if a "6" or lower is rolled, then a
number of population is lost equal to the number listed on the current space of
the Jump Preparation track. Players then follow all steps for "Jumping the
Fleet" on this page. Example: The fleet token is on the second-to-last space of
the Jump Preparation track (the -1 population space). The current player
activates the "FTL Control" location to jump the fleet. They roll a die, and it
is a "5" (which is "6" or less), so the fleet loses 1 population.

### Destination Cards

Each Destination Card has two important pieces of information on it. In the
center of the card are the special effects of traveling to this destination.
These effects usually include losing fuel or other resources and/or following
special instructions. The effects of a Destination Card are immediately
followed when the fleet travels to that destination. The bottom of each
Destination Card lists a distance number. After the special effects of the card
are followed, it is placed faceup next to the Kobol Objective Card, so that the
total distance the fleet has traveled can easily be seen.

### Using Abilities

Character sheets, Skill Cards, Loyalty Cards, and Quorum Cards can all provide
abilities to players. Many abilities are prefaced with the word "Action"
followed by a colon, which means that the character may only use it as their
action during their Action step. All other abilities do not require an action,
and are used when specified. If multiple players wish to use an ability at the
same time, the current player decides the order.

Example: An unmanned viper has just been attacked by a raider and an "8" is
rolled. Starbuck plays an "Evasive Maneuvers" piloting card, which allows them
to reroll the die.

### Kobol Objective Card

The Kobol Objective Card lists important information, including when additional
Loyalty Cards are dealt out and how the human players can win the game. When
the fleet equals or exceeds a listed distance total for the first time, the
players perform the following instructions. These instructions are also
summarized on the Kobol Objective Card.

 - When Sleeper Agents: four or more units of distance have been traveled, the
   remaining Loyalty Cards are dealt out (see "Sleeper Agents Phase" on page
   18).
 - After Reach Kobol: eight or more units of distance have been traveled, the
   humans are only one jump away from winning the game. The next time the
   humans jump, they do not draw a Destination Card; instead, they simply win
   the game (as long as every resource is higher than 0).

Example: The human players have 1 population resource remaining and have
traveled 8 units of distance. William Adama uses the "FTL Control" location to
jump the fleet. The humans will win the game due to this jump, as long as they
do not lose any population due to the "FTL Control" location.

Example of Jumping

1. During the Prepare for Jump step, the current Crisis Card has the prepare
   for jump icon. The fleet marker is moved one space ahead on the Jump
   Preparation track. Since this causes the token to enter the Auto Jump space,
   the fleet jumps. All ships are removed from the game board.
2. The Admiral draws the top two cards of the Destination deck and chooses one
   to play faceup. The other card is returned to the bottom of the deck.
3. The chosen card is placed faceup next to the Kobol Objective Card. The
   instructions on the Destination Card are then followed (in this case, to
   lose 1 fuel and destroy 1 raptor).
4. If this had caused the total distance to equal or exceed four (or eight)
   units for the first time, then the instructions on the Kobol Card would be
   followed. In this example, nothing happens since neither of these totals was
   exceeded for the first time.
5. The fleet token is moved back to the start of the Jump Preparation track.

### Skill Cards

At the start of each player's turn, they draw the number and types of Skill
Cards indicated by their skill set (listed on their character sheet). These are
always drawn regardless of how many cards are already in their hand. These
cards are used to overcome skill checks or to provide players with special
actions (and other abilities) that they can perform. Each skill type
specializes in different strategies:

 - Politics: This skill represents a character's ability to control morale and
   help the fleet overcome crises. This is the most common skill type required
   by Crisis Cards. Some politics cards also provide the ability to allow a
   player draw Skill Cards from outside their skill set.
 - Leadership: This skill represents a character's ability to take charge of
   situations and command other individuals. This is the second-most common
   skill type required by Crisis Cards. Some leadership cards allow players to
   move other characters and grant them a bonus action.
 - Tactics: This skill type represents a character's ability to plan missions
   as well as to physically overcome obstacles. Tactics cards allow players to
   gain bonuses to die rolls as well as scout the galaxy for new destinations.
 - Piloting: This skill represents a character's ability to fly vipers.
   Piloting cards allow players to reroll enemy attack rolls as well as gain
   additional attacks.
 - Engineering: This skill represents a character's strength in the mechanical
   and scientific fields. Some engineering cards allow players to repair vipers
   and locations aboard Galactica.

### Hand Limit and Discarding

If a player has more than 10 Skill Cards in their hand at the end of any
player's turn, they must discard cards (of their choice) until they have
only 10. This hand limit does not include other cards, such as Quorum Cards or
Super Crisis Cards that may be in a player's hand.

Whenever a player discards a Skill Card, it is placed in a discard pile faceup
next to the appropriate Skill deck. When a deck runs out of Skill Cards, the
discard pile is shuffled to create a new Skill deck.

### Destiny Deck

At the start of the game, a deck of 10 Skill Cards (two of each type) is
created and shuffled. Two random cards from this deck are placed into each
skill check, and add an element of uncertainty.

After the last card from the Destiny deck is played, the current player creates
a new one by dealing out two cards of each skill type. They then shuffle those
cards thoroughly and place them on the appropriate space on the game board. The
Destiny Deck Space on the Game Board

### Skill Checks

Many Crisis Cards and game board locations require skill checks. Skill checks
represent struggles and challenges that require particular skill types to
overcome. They are always represented by a difficulty number (listed first)
followed by the necessary skill types (colored boxes). All skill checks are
resolved as follows:

1. Read Card: The current player reads the entire card (or location) out loud
   to all players. Players may then discuss what they would like to do
   (following the guidelines under "Secrecy Rules" on page 20). If the card
   requires the current player, the President, or the Admiral to make a choice,
   they must make the decision at this time. Any choice that does not have a
   pass/fail effect requires players to carry out specific instructions instead
   of a making a skill check.
2. Play from Destiny Deck: Two cards from the Destiny deck are dealt facedown
   together, starting a common pile. This pile can be placed on the Battlestar
   Galactica logo of the game board, or any common area that is in reach of all
   players.
3. Play Skills: Starting with the player that is to the left of the current
   player (and ending with the current player), each player may play any number
   of Skill Cards from their hand facedown to the common pile. Any text on the
   Skill Cards played onto the pile in this manner is ignored. Only the
   strength and types of skills on each Skill Card is relevant when played into
   a skill check.
4. Shuffle and Divide Cards: After each player has had one opportunity to play
   Skill Cards, the current player takes all Skill Cards from the pile and
   shuffles them. (The cards are shuffled so none of the players will know
   which players contributed which cards to the pile.) They then deal them
   faceup into two new piles. All cards that match a skill type (color) listed
   on the Crisis Card are placed in one pile, and all other cards (i.e., those
   that do not match) are placed in the other pile.
5. Total Strength: The total strength (upper left number) of each card pile is
   totaled. The total strength of the nonmatching pile is subtracted from the
   total strength of the matching pile, giving a final strength.
6. Determine Result: If the final strength is equal to or greater than the
   skill check's difficulty, then the "pass" result of the skill check is
   carried out. Otherwise, the "fail" result is followed. All Skill Cards
   contributed toward the skill check are then discarded into the appropriate
   discard piles.

#### Partial Passes

Some skill checks have a partial pass number listed between
the "pass" and "fail" results. If the skill check is not passed,
but this partial pass number is equaled or exceeded, then this
result is followed (instead of the "pass" or "fail" results).
A Crisis Card with a Partial Pass Result

#### Skill Supervisor

Although it is technically the current player's responsibility to make sure
that Skill Cards are discarded properly, many play groups prefer to assign one
player the role of **SKILL SUPERVISOR** at the start of the game. This player
is in charge of sorting discarded Skill Cards into the appropriate discard
piles. In addition, when a Skill deck runs out, this player is responsible for
reshuffling the appropriate discard pile to form a new deck. Lastly, when the
Destiny deck runs out, this player is in charge of creating a new Destiny deck
(by collecting two of each Skill Card type and then shuffling them together).

Example of a Skill Check

1. During their Crisis step, the current player draws the "Fulfiller of
   Prophecy" Crisis Card. They read it aloud and must choose whether to perform
   a skill check (the top option) or resolve the bottom section. They choose
   the top option, and will therefore resolve a skill check.
2. Two cards from the Destiny deck are dealt into a common pile.
3. The player to the current player's left plays two Skill Cards into the pile.
   The next player decides not to play any cards, and finally, the current
   player plays a single card.
4. The current player shuffles the pile of cards and divides them into two new
   piles. Cards that match the skill types on the Crisis Card are placed in one
   pile, and nonmatching cards are placed in the other.
5. Both piles are individually totaled. The non-matching pile total of "3" is
   then subtracted from the matching pile of total "6," providing a final
   strength of "3."
6. Since the final strength did not equal or exceed the difficulty of the skill
   check, the "fail" result is performed. The fleet loses 1 population, and the
   current player adjusts the population resource dial (from 12 to 11).

### Game Board Skill Checks

Three game board locations - "Administration," "Admiral's
Quarters," and the "Brig," - instruct the player using the
location to carry out a skill check. In these cases, a skill check
is resolved (following the rules on page 16). The specific rules
for skill checks at these locations are found below:

 - Administration: The current player chooses any player to nominate for the
   presidency. A 5 difficulty politics/ leadership skill check is resolved with
   the following results.
   - Pass: The nominated player claims
     the President title.
   - Fail: No Effect.
 - Admiral's Quarters: The current player chooses any character to accuse. A 7
   difficulty leadership/ tactics skill check is resolved with the following
   results.
   - Pass: The accused character is moved to the "Brig."
   - No Effect. Fail:
 - Brig: The current player attempts to escape the "Brig" location. A 7
   difficulty politics/tactics skill check is resolved with the following
   results.
   - Pass: The current player may move their character to any space on
     Galactica.
   - Fail: No Effect.

## Cylon Players

In each game, there will be at least one Cylon player working against the
humans. The number of Cylon players varies based upon the number of people
playing the game.

### Cylon Objective

For the Cylon players to win the game, they must prevent the humans from
completing the Kobol Objective. There are three possible ways of doing this:

 - Run Out a Resource: If at least one resource is depleted to 0 or less at the
   end of a player's turn, the game immediately ends and the Cylon players win.
   This is the most common way the Cylons to win. Note that it is possible for
   the human players to reach 0 of a resource type and then increase it during
   the same turn without losing the game.
 - Centurion Invasion: If at least one centurion marker reaches the end of the
   Boarding Party track, then the crew of the Galactica are killed and the
   Cylon players win (see "Activate Heavy Raiders and Centurions" on page 24).
 - Galactica Destroyed: If six or more locations on Galactica have damage
   tokens on them at the same time, then Galactica is destroyed and the Cylon
   players win (see "Damage Tokens" on page 25).

### Loyalty Cards

Each player starts the game with one Loyalty Card. Later in the game, players
receive additional Loyalty Cards (see "Sleeper Agent Phase" on page 19), which
increase their chances of being Cylon players.

Loyalty Cards are kept facedown, but their owners may look at them at any time.
A player may not look at other players' Loyalty Cards unless specifically
allowed to do so by a card or ability. When a player is allowed to look at a
single Loyalty Card belonging to a player who has more than one, the card
viewed is selected randomly.

Each Loyalty Card specifies whether the controlling player is a Cylon, is not a
Cylon, or is a Sympathizer (see "Sympathizer" on page 19).

Important: If a player has at least one "You are a Cylon" card, then they are a
Cylon player and ignores all "You are not a Cylon" cards that they may have.

### Sleeper Agent Phase

Once the fleet has traveled at least four distance, each
player (including revealed Cylon players) is dealt one card
from the top of the Loyalty deck. If a player receives a "You
are a Sympathizer" card, then they must immediately reveal
and resolve it. If they are a revealed Cylon player, then they may
first give the card to any other player (who then immediately
resolves it).

## Sympathizer

In addition to human and Cylon players, there may be a Sympathizer inside the
fleet. The "You Are a Sympathizer" card represents a human or Cylon who wishes
to side with the other team, and is only used in a four or six player game.
This card is not added to the Loyalty deck until after the initial Loyalty
Cards have been dealt out.

A player who receives this card must immediately reveal it. If at least 1
resource is half full or lower (in the red zone), then the player is moved to
the "Brig" location. This card is then treated as a "You Are Not a Cylon" card.

If every resource is more than half full (not in the red zone), then this
player becomes a revealed Cylon player for the remainder of the game and
follows the game turn steps described under "Revealed Cylon Players" on this
page (except for steps "4" and "5.") This player may never activate the "Cylon
Fleet" location or play Super Crisis Cards.

### Determining if You Are a Cylon

Carl "Helo" Agathon has two Loyalty Cards, one "You Are a Cylon" card and one
"You Are Not a Cylon" card. Since they have at least one "You are a Cylon"
card, they are a Cylon player. They may reveal themself on their turn (as an
action) to perform the special ability listed on their Loyalty Card. If they do
so, they become a revealed Cylon player (see below).

### Revealed Cylon Players

A player who has a "You are a Cylon" Loyalty Card may reveal it as an action.
After a player has revealed themself as a Cylon, they perform the following
steps:

1. Discard: The player discards down to three Skill Cards.
2. Lose Titles: If the player had any Title Cards, they are given to a
   different player (see "Line of Succession" on page 28).
3. Resurrect: The player moves their character token to the "Resurrection Ship"
   Cylon location.
4. Receive Super Crisis: The player receives one random Super Crisis Card. This
   card remains in their hand and may be played by activating the "Caprica"
   Cylon location. Super Crisis Cards are treated like normal Crisis Cards, but
   are immune to all character abilities that affect Crisis Cards.
5. End Turn: The player's turn then ends, and the current player token is
   passed to the player on their left. Note that a player who reveals themself
   as a Cylon does not draw a Crisis Card at the end of this turn, or any of
   their future turns (see "Revealed Cylon Players' Turns," below).

#### Revealed Cylon Players' Turns

On a revealed Cylon player's turn, they do not receive Skill Cards based on
their skill set or draw Crisis Cards. They simply draw 2 cards, moves to any
Cylon location, and then may use the action on it.

1. Draw Skills Step: The Cylon player may draw two Skill Cards of any type(s).
2. Movement Step: The Cylon player may move to any other Cylon location.
3. Action Step: The Cylon player may perform the action listed on their current
   location. Revealed Cylons may not perform other actions, such as those found
   on Skill Cards or Quorum Cards. All of the abilities listed on a revealed
   Cylon player's character sheet are also ignored.

**Important Note:** There are no "Activate Cylon Ship" and "Prepare for Jump"
steps during a revealed Cylon player's turn.

#### Revealed Cylons and Crises

Although revealed Cylon players do not automatically draw a Crisis Card on
their turn, they may draw and play a Crisis Card by using the "Caprica" Cylon
location. When a revealed Cylon player draws a Crisis Card that poses a choice
for the current player, that player makes the decision.

Revealed Cylon players are unaffected by abilities on Crisis Cards and skill
checks. They cannot be sent to the "Brig" or "Sickbay" locations, and cannot be
forced to discard Skill Cards.

#### Revealed Cylon Players' Skill Cards

Revealed Cylon players only draw two Skill Cards on their turns. A revealed
Cylon player may - at their option - play one (and only one) Skill Card into
each skill check that is resolved.

Revealed Cylon players may not use actions or abilities listed on Skill Cards.
They must continue to obey the hand limit rule, and discard down to 10 Skill
Cards at the end of each player's turn.

The Destiny deck is still used after a Cylon player has been revealed.

## Secrecy

A key element of Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game is the paranoia and
tension surrounding the hidden Cylon players. Because of this, secrecy is very
important, and the following rules must be observed at all times:

 - Blind Accusations: Players may accuse each other of being Cylon operatives
   at any time. Although these blind accusations have no game rule effects,
   they can help, or confuse, the human players in their hunt to find the
   Cylons.
 - Open Accusations: Should one player gain the ability to look at another
   player's Loyalty Cards, they may choose to keep this information to
   themself, share it with the group, or even lie about it.
 - Skill Checks: Players are Skill Cards and prohibited from revealing the
   exact strength of cards in their hands. They may use vague terms such as "I
   can help out on this crisis a little bit," but they may not make more
   specific statements such as "I am playing 5 piloting." In addition, after a
   skill check is resolved, players may not identify which cards they played.
   The reason for these restrictions is to keep hidden information secret and
   to protect Cylon players from being discovered too easily.
 - Decks: If a player has the ability to look Cards in the at cards on the top
   of a deck, they may not disclose specific information about that card.
 - Revealed Cylons: Revealed Cylon players must also follow all rules of
   secrecy. They may not show their hands to other players and may not say
   which Super Crisis Card they have in their hands.

## Ship Reference

### Galactica

This large ship leads and defends the human fleet, and is depicted in the
center of the game board. There are many locations on Galactica where
characters can take different actions.

### Colonial One

This ship, smaller than Galactica, is the President's base of operations and is
depicted at the top of the game board. There are several locations on Colonial
One where characters can take different actions.

### Vipers

These plastic ships are used by the humans to defend their fleet and to attack
Cylon ships. Vipers are placed in the "Reserves," "Damaged Vipers," or space
areas of the game board.

### Raptors

These plastic ships are used by the humans to scout for new destinations, as
well as to attempt to find more resources (such as fuel and food). These ships
are never used in combat and remain in the "Reserves" until destroyed.

### Civilian Ships

These small tokens represent unarmed human ships. When one of these ships is
destroyed, the resources (usually population) listed on the face of the token
are lost. These ships are always kept facedown.

### Basestars

These large Cylon ships are represented by large punchboard tokens. These ships
are often placed in different space areas and can both attack Galactica
directly and launch raiders and heavy raiders.

### Raiders

These plastic ships are used by the Cylons to attack the fleet. These fragile
ships are plentiful, and often attack vipers and civilian ships.

### Heavy Raiders

These plastic ships are used by the Cylons to land boarding parties on
Galactica. These ships never attack other ships; their sole purpose is to reach
the hangar deck and release their deadly centurion boarding parties.

## Combat

As long as there is at least one Cylon ship on the game board, the fleet is
considered to be in combat. Cylon ships are activated at the end of each turn,
based upon the Crisis Card drawn. This section describes the details of combat,
including how to activate, attack, and pilot ships.

### Cylon Attack Cards

When a Cylon attack Crisis Card is drawn, the following steps are performed as
listed on the card:

1. Activate Existing Cylon Ships: Any existing Cylon ships are activated based
   upon the icon(s) listed on the card. If there are multiple icons listed,
   they are activated from left to right, following standard activation rules
   (see "Activating Cylon Ships" below).
2. Setup: Place new Cylon ships, vipers, and civilian ships on the game board
   as illustrated on the card. Vipers are always placed from the "Reserves" and
   civilian ships are always drawn randomly from among those in the stockpile
   and are placed on the game board facedown.
3. Special Rules: Most Cylon attack Crisis Cards have a special rule on them,
   which is followed at this time.

A Cylon attack card is discarded once these three steps have been carried out,
unless the card specifies "Keep this card in play," in which case it has an
ongoing ability that usually lasts until the fleet jumps.

### Activating Cylon Ships

While in combat, the Cylon ships are activated after the Resolve Crisis step of
each player's turn. Activating a ship causes it to either move or attack. Cylon
ships are always activated according to the rules below, even if there is a
revealed Cylon player.

If multiple space areas contain ships that need to be activated, the ships are
activated one entire space area at a time in the order of the current player's
choice. Each Cylon ship can only be activated once on a given player's turn.

#### Activate Raiders

When activated, each Cylon raider carries out only one of the actions listed
below, taking only the first action that it is able to perform (in numerical
priority, with "Attack a Viper" taking the highest priority and "Attack
Galactica" taking the lowest).

1. Attack a Viper: The raider attacks a viper in its space area. It attacks an
   unmanned viper if able; otherwise it attacks a piloted viper.
2. Destroy Civilian Ship: If there are no vipers in its area, the raider
   destroys one civilian ship in its area. The current player chooses a
   civilian ship in the area and flips it over. The resources listed on its
   face are lost, and the token is removed from the game.
3. Move: If there are no civilian ships in the area, the viper moves one space
   area towards the nearest civilian ship. If several civilian ships are
   equidistant, it moves clockwise around Galactica.
4. Attack Galactica: If there are no civilian ships on the game board, the
   raider attacks Galactica (see "Attacking" on page 24).

If there are no raiders on the game board when raiders are activated, two
raiders are launched from each basestar. If there are no basestars in play,
then nothing happens.

Example: The current Crisis Card has been resolved and has the activate raider
icon on it. All Cylon raiders on the game board (they are all in the same area)
are activated. The first raider attacks a viper in its area and destroys it. As
a result, there are no vipers or civilian ships in the second raider's area, so
it moves to an adjacent space (towards the nearest civilian ship).

#### Launch Raiders

When the launch raiders icon appears, each basestar launches three raiders. If
there are no basestars in play, then nothing happens.

Whenever a raider (or heavy raider) is launched, the current
player takes a ship of the specified type from among those
not currently on the game board. They then place it in the
launching basestar's area. If all of the raiders are on the game
board, then no more raiders may be launched.

#### Activating Cylon Raiders

1. During the Activate Cylon Ships step, the current Crisis Card has the
   activate raiders icon. There are multiple raiders on the board, so the
   current player chooses an area and activates the raiders in that area (one
   at a time).
2. The first raider attacks a viper in its area, rolls a "5," and damages the
   viper.
3. The other raider in the area does not have any vipers to attack, so it
   destroys a civilian ship in its area. The civilian ship token is turned
   over, and the resources on its face (2 population) are lost.
4. The next area to be activated has a single raider in it. Since there are no
   ships in its area, the ship moves towards the nearest civilian ship
   (clockwise). The next time the raider is activated, it will most likely
   destroy the civilian ship in its area.

#### Activate Heavy Raiders and Centurions

Heavy raiders never attack. They always move towards the nearest space area
containing a viper launch icon. If a heavy raider starts its movement in a
space with a viper launch icon, the centurions on it board Galactica.

When centurions from a heavy raider board Galactica, that heavy raider is
removed from the game board, and a centurion token is placed on the start space
of the Boarding Party track. Whenever there are any centurion tokens on the
Boarding Party track and heavy raiders are activated (even by a revealed Cylon
player), each centurion token moves one space towards the "Humans Lose" space.
If a centurion token reaches the end of the track, then the Cylons win the
game.

The human players can attempt to destroy centurions by activating the "Armory"
location on the game board.

If there are no heavy raiders on the game board when heavy raiders are
activated, one heavy raider is launched from each basestar. If there are no
basestars in play, then nothing happens.

#### Activate Cylon Basestars

When a Cylon basestar is activated, the basestar attacks
Galactica. The current player rolls a die for each basestar on
the game board to find out if the attack damages Galactica
(see "Attacking," on this page).

### Attacking

Whenever a ship attacks, the current player rolls an eight-sided
die and consults the entry on the table that corresponds
to the target of the attack (and, sometimes, the method of
the attack). Depending upon the rolled result, the target can
become damaged or be destroyed.

Note that players may never attack human ships with vipers
or with the "Weapon's Control" location.

#### Damage, Destruction, and Remove from Game

Depending upon the ship type, different things happen if a ship is damaged or
destroyed.

### Attack Table

| Unit Attacked          | Die Result                             |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Cylon Raider           | 3-8 = Destroyed                        |
| Heavy Raider/Centurion | 7-8 = Destroyed                        |
| Viper                  | 5-7 = Destroyed<br>8 = Destroyed       |
| Civilian Ship          | Automatically Destroyed (no dice roll) |
| Battlestar Galactica   | <div>*With Raider:* 8 = Damaged</div><div>*With Basestar:* 4-8 = Damaged</div> |
| Cylon Basestar         | <table><tr><td>*With Viper:*</td><td>8 = Damaged</td></tr><tr><td>*With Galactica:*</td><td>5-8 = Damaged</td></tr><tr><td>*With Nuke:*</td><td>1-2 = Damaged Twice<br>3-6 = Destroyed<br>7-8 = Destroyed and destroy 3 raiders in the same area</td></tr></table> |

When a Cylon ship is destroyed, it is removed from the game board, but may
return later in the game. When a viper is damaged, it is placed in the "Damaged
Viper" box of the game board. A viper in this box may not be launched or used
until it has been repaired (usually by an engineering card).

When a viper or raptor is destroyed, it is removed from the game. When a
civilian ship is destroyed, it is turned faceup. The fleet then loses the
resources (usually population) listed on the token. The token is then removed
from the game.

Whenever a ship (or other component) is removed from the
game, it is placed in the game box and may not be used for
the remainder of the game.

#### Damage Tokens

When a basestar or Galactica is damaged, the current player
draws a random damage token of the appropriate ship type.
Their effects vary depending on the token type.

 - Damage Location: When drawn, this token is placed on the matching location
   on Galactica. All characters in this location are moved to "Sickbay."
   Characters may move into a damaged location, but may not use the action
   listed on it (until repaired by an engineering card). When a damaged
   location is repaired, return the damage token to the pile of unused damage
   tokens and randomize them
 - Lost Resource: When drawn, the fleet loses the listed resources. This token
   is then removed from the game.
 - Critical Hit: When drawn, this token is placed on the basestar. While it
   remains, it counts as two damage tokens (it takes three damage tokens to
   destroy a basestar).
 - Disabled Hanger: When drawn, this token is placed on the basestar. While it
   remains, the basestar may not launch raiders or heavy raiders.
 - Disabled Weapons: When drawn, this token is placed on the basestar. While it
   remains, the basestar may not attack Galactica.
 - Structural Damage: When drawn, this token is placed on the basestar. While
   it remains, all attacks against the basestar gain +2 to their die rolls.

If a basestar receives three or more damage tokens, then it is destroyed and is
removed from the game board. All damage tokens on it are returned and randomly
mixed into the pile of unused damage tokens.

If six or more areas on Galactica have damage tokens at the same time, then the
Cylon players win the game.

### Jumping During Combat

When the fleet jumps during combat, all ships are removed from the space areas
of the game board. Any vipers so removed are returned to the "Reserves," and
any civilian ships so removed are shuffled back into the pile of unused
civilian ships. Any character who was piloting a viper is moved to the "Hangar
Deck" location.

Any centurion tokens on the Boarding Party track remain in play when the fleet
jumps.

### Activating Vipers

Although Galactica does have mounted weaponry, its real military strength lies
in its squadrons of single-man fighters known as vipers. The main purpose of
vipers is to defend the fleet, particularly civilian ships, from Cylon ships.
Vipers are usually activated by using the "Command" location.

When a player activates a viper, they must choose one of the following options:

 - Launch a Viper: The player takes a viper from the "Reserves" and places it
   in one of the two space areas marked with the viper launch icon (see page
   24).
 - Move a Viper: The player chooses a viper that is already in a space area.
   They may move the viper to an adjacent space area. Note that vipers may not
   fly "over" Galactica; they may only move clockwise or counterclockwise
   "around" it, between directly adjacent space areas.
 - Attack with a Viper: The player chooses a viper and a Cylon ship that are in
   the same space area. They then roll one eight-sided die to resolve an attack
   following the rules under "Attacking" on page 24.

Each viper may be activated any number of times during a player's turn, but
players may not activate ships that are being piloted by another player. Vipers
without piloting tokens under them are referred to as unmanned vipers.

### Piloting Vipers

All characters who have piloting in their skill set have the ability to
personally pilot a viper. A piloted viper functions slightly differently than
an unmanned viper and may not be activated using the "Command" location.

A player who wants their character to pilot a viper simply moves their
character to the "Hangar Deck" location and uses the action listed there. They
then launch a viper as normal (see the previous section), place their piloting
token beneath it, and remove their character token from the game board, placing
it on their character sheet.

#### Moving and Actions when Piloting

While a character is piloting a viper, their player still takes their turn as
normal. During their Movement step, they may move the viper to an adjacent
space area or move their character back to a location (see "Moving From a
Viper" below).

In addition to the normal things that a player may do during their Action step
(for example, play a Skill Card), they may also choose to activate their viper
(to move again or attack).

#### Viper Destruction

If a character is piloting a viper when it is damaged or destroyed, their
character token is placed in "Sickbay," and the viper is placed in the
appropriate space (the "Damaged Vipers" area or back in the game box.)

#### Moving from a Viper

When the fleet jumps, all characters who were piloting vipers are placed in the
"Hangar Deck," and their vipers are returned to the "Reserves."

A player may also choose to move to Galactica or Colonial One from a viper
during their Movement step. In order to do this, they must discard one Skill
Card, and then they simply place their viper in the "Reserves" and their
character token on the location of their choice. They may do this from any
space area.

If a player is sent to "Sickbay" or the "Brig" while piloting a viper, they are
moved to the appropriate location, and their viper is returned to the
"Reserves."

Whenever a character moves from piloting a viper to a location, their piloting
token is removed from the game board.

### Raptors and Risking

Raptors are not used during combat and are usually "risked" according to the
instructions on Skill and Destination Cards to receive particular rewards. In
order to risk a ship, there must be at least one of the required type of ship
in the "Reserves." These cards usually instruct the player to roll a die and
receive a reward if they reach a specified number. If the die roll is less than
the number, then the risked ships listed on the card are destroyed, and no
reward is gained.

Example: The current player plays the "Launch Scout" tactics card as an action.
The card specifies that they may risk a raptor to look at the top card of the
Destination or Crisis deck. Because there is at least one raptor in the
"Reserves," the player is able to take this action. They roll a die as
instructed, and rolls a "1." Since this does not reach the target number of 3,
they do not gain the reward and a raptor is destroyed.

### Piloting a Viper and Attacking

1. "Starbuck" uses the action in the "Hangar Deck" location to launch themself
   in a viper. They remove their character token from the board, launches a
   viper, and places their piloting token under it.
2. They may then take another action (as specified on the "Hangar Deck"
   location). They decide to use the action to activate their viper and attack
   a raider in their area.
3. They roll a "3," which is exactly enough to destroy the raider. It is
   removed from the game board, and they proceed to their Crisis Step.

Note that Starbuck may not use their character's "Expert Pilot" ability (found
on their character sheet) in this example because they were not piloting a
viper at the start of their turn.

## Other Rules

Detailed in this section are miscellaneous rules, including the line of
succession for the Admiral and President titles, the way component limitations
affect gameplay, and ways to adjust the game to make it less difficult for
either the humans or Cylons.

### Line of Succession

Should the President or Admiral be revealed as a Cylon, the next player in the
line of succession for that title claims it. In addition, if the Admiral (but
not the President) is placed in the "Brig," then the next player in line claims
the Admiral title. If an Admiral stripped of their title later moves out of the
"Brig," they do not automatically reclaim the title.

The orders of succession are:

#### Admiral

1. William Adama
2. Saul Tigh
3. Helo Agathon
4. Lee "Apollo" Adama
5. Kara "Starbuck" Thrace
6. Sharon "Boomer" Valerii
7. Galen Tyrol
8. Tom Zarek
9. Gaius Baltar
10. Laura Roslin

#### President
1. Laura Roslin
2. Gaius Baltar
3. Tom Zarek
4. Lee "Apollo" Adama
5. William Adama
6. Karl "Helo" Agathon
7. Galen Tyrol
8. Sharon "Boomer" Valerii
9. Saul Tigh
10. Kara "Starbuck" Thrace

Note that if the President is in the "Brig," they keep the President title and
all associated abilities.

### Component Limitations

Whenever a deck of cards runs out, the current player shuffles the appropriate
discard pile to form a new deck. This includes Skill Cards, Quorum Cards,
Crisis Cards, Super Crisis Cards, and Destination Cards.

Tokens and plastic ships are limited to the quantity provided, and can run out
during the game. The current player always decides the order in which a
component type is placed, and if there are not enough, they decide which ones
are not placed.

Example: A Cylon attack Crisis Card is drawn that requires two basestars to be
placed on the game board. There is already one basestar on the game board, so
there is only one more that can be placed. The current player decides which of
the two basestars listed on the Cylon attack card to place on the game board.

If all vipers are already in play and a player wishes to activate the "Hangar
Deck" location, they may choose to move a viper from any space area to the
"Reserves" so that they may pilot it.

### Adjusting Difficulty

Some play groups may find that it is too easy for the human or Cylon players to
win the game. A group may decide before the start of the game to make the game
easier for the humans or Cylons.

To make the game easier for the human players, start the game with 2 more of
each resource (10 food, 10 fuel, 12 morale, and 14 population).

To make the game easier for the Cylons, start the game with 2 less of each
resource.

### Human Player Strategy

The ultimate goal for the human players is to conserve enough resources to
travel eight units of distance and then jump to Kobol. This makes their
immediate goal to preserve resources, and their long-term goal to travel enough
distance.

#### On the Humans' Turns

Two things need to be taken into account during a human player's turn: first,
which resources are in the most danger, and second, which actions are available
to the player.

Each character type has a particular specialization. For example, pilots are
good at piloting vipers and destroying Cylon ships, while political leaders are
good at overcoming Crisis Cards and using the Quorum deck.

At the start of the game, it is important to make sure that resources lost are
not all of the same type. For example, morale is most often lost from Crisis
Cards, and the loss of morale can often get out of control. Alternatively,
population is usually safe from Crisis Cards, but in grave danger when the
Cylons attack.

It is also important to be able to determine when to use the "FTL Control"
location. For example, it is often not a good idea to use "FTL Control" when
population is running low.

#### Dealing with Cylon Players

The biggest threat to the human players is posed by the Cylons who have
infiltrated the fleet. Human players should try to keep an eye on the negative
Skill Cards that come up during skill checks and should question each decision
made on Crisis Cards. The sooner the humans can get the Cylon players into the
"Brig" location, the better. A Cylon player in the "Brig" has limited impact on
the game, and is less harmful if they decide to reveal themself.

#### Preparing for the Sleeper Agent Phase

It is important for human players to keep in mind that even if they do not
start as a Cylon, that may change during the Sleeper Agent phase. At the start
of the game, it may be a good strategy for the humans to avoid doing too well,
because one of them may become a Cylon player during the Sleeper Agent phase.
Performing exceptionally well as a human may make winning the game more
difficult for a player who switches over to the Cylon side.

### Cylon Player Strategy

The ultimate goal of the Cylon players is to make sure the humans lose the
game, usually by focusing on a single resource type and running it down to
nothing.

#### While Unrevealed

During skill checks, Cylon players should find any and all reasons to avoid
helping out. When they do help out, they should make sure to throw in a
negative card (or two) to cancel out their help. However, Cylon players should
be careful not to look too suspicious and should make sure to use resource
types that other players could have thrown in as well. Often times, the best
way to avoid suspicion is to make other players seem more suspicious.

It is fairly important for Cylon players to avoid being placed in the "Brig"
while unrevealed. While in the "Brig," Cylon players cannot use the special
ability on their Loyalty Cards (but may still reveal themselves). It is often
worthwhile to throw other players in the "Brig" to avoid suspicion.

A properly timed reveal can be devastating to the humans. Cylon players should
pay attention to the special ability of their Loyalty Cards and wait for the
perfect time to strike.

#### While Revealed

Revealed Cylons have one main purpose: to focus on the weakest resource and
destroy it. Morale and population are usually the two easiest resources to
decrease. Morale is easiest to decrease by Crisis Cards (through the "Caprica"
location), while population is easiest to destroy with Cylon attacks (using the
"Cylon Fleet" location).

Revealed Cylon players should usually draw piloting or engineering Skill Cards
on their turn, since these types appear on Crisis Cards least frequently.

### Card Clarifications

This section clarifies the effects of some cards.

 - Resource Maximums: Although resources can sometimes be increased by cards,
   they can never be raised higher than 15.
 - "Food Shortage" Crisis Card: This card causes the President and current
   player to discard two cards each. If the President is the current player,
   then they must discard four cards.
 - Choice Crises: When a player makes a choice on a Crisis Card, they can
   always choose the top or bottom section of the card, regardless of whether
   they will be able to fulfill the game text listed (unless the card
   specifically restricts this).

### Frequently Overlooked Rules

 - Players always draw all Skill Cards indicated on their character sheet at
   the start of their turn, regardless of hand size.
 - Ships may only move into adjacent space areas. They may not move over
   Galactica.
 - When a player receives a "You are a Sympathizer" card, they must immediately reveal it.
 - When using the "FTL Control" location, population is lost according to the
   Jump Preparation track on a roll of 6 or less.
 - Each player must discard down to 10 Skill Cards at the end of every player's
   turn.
 - Players may move out of "Sickbay" without difficulty, but not the "Brig."
   They may only move out of the "Brig" by passing the skill check listed on
   the location.
 - Cylon players may only reveal their Loyalty Cards as an Action.
 - Revealed Cylon players are dealt a Loyalty Card during the Sleeper Agent
   phase.
 - Cylon ships are always activated according to the "Activate Cylon Ships"
   rules (page 22), even if there is a revealed Cylon player.
 - Super Crisis Cards are immune to character abilities that specifically
   affect Crisis Cards.

## Quick Reference

### Player Turn

1. Receive Skills Step: Draw Skill Cards according to the skill set on your
   character sheet. Revealed Cylon players draw two Skill Cards of any type(s).
2. Movement Step: Move to any location. If moving to another ship, you must
   discard one Skill Card.
3. Action Step: Activate your location, or use a card that costs an action.
4. Crisis Step: The top card of the Crisis deck is resolved.
5. Activate Cylon Ships Step: Cylon ships are activated according to the Crisis
   Card.
6. Prepare for Jump Step: If the Crisis Card has the jump icon on it, advance
   the marker one space on the Jump Preparation track. If the marker is at the
   end of the track, then jump the fleet.

Important Note: There are no "Activate Cylon Ship" and "Prepare for Jump" steps
during a revealed Cylon player's turn.

### Activating a Viper

There are three possible things that a player may do when activating a viper:

 - Launch a viper
 - Move a viper
 - Attack with a viper

### Activating Cylon Ships

Raiders: Will take one of the following actions (topmost).

1. Attack a viper in its area (unmanned if able).
2. Destroy a civilian ship in its area (current player's choice).
3. Move towards nearest civilian ship (if tied, move clockwise).
4. Attack Galactica.

If no Raiders are in play, launch two raiders from each Basestar.

Heavy Raiders: Never attack and always move towards the nearest viper launch
icon. If activated in a space with a viper launch icon, their centurions board
Galactica (see page 24). Each time heavy raiders are activated, centurions are
also activated. If there are no heavy raiders in play when a crisis activates
them, instead launch one heavy raider from each Basestar in play.
